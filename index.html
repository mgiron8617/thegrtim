            Grande started off on Broadway before landing her first gig on the
            hit nickelodeon show ‘Victorious’. As Grande has stated before, her
            dream role was to portray Glinda in a movie version of the musical
            if there were to ever be one. In this case, Grande manifested her
            hopes into reality now that she is able to say she was granted what
            she dreamed of when she was younger.

        <hr class="under-title" />
        <div class="paragraph-2">
          <p class="text">
            The singer has been teasing a new beauty line for months and has
            eventually begun promoting her new brand to her fans. On the 12th of
            November in 2021, Grande announced the release of her makeup line,
            r.e.m. beauty. She expressed online, “i cannot wait to see what you
            beautiful humans create with these products and how they inspire to
            express yourselves’.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This latest celebrity’s makeup line has been in the works for two
            years and includes a variety of cosmetics to start off this new
            venture for the talented singer. From lip to eye products, fans can
            begin to get their hands on the newest cosmetics online through
            rembeauty.com. Future cosmetics are also in the works.
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            Through the looks of the makeup line, the pop icon was inspired by
            vintage sci-fi from the 60’s which enabled her vision to create
            products and promotionals that exhibit that exact era. The singer
            had envisioned this beauty aesthetic from the start and planned the
            concept immediately. By incorporating astronauts, planets, and her
            love of 60’s fashion, the singer created a brand that gives
            nostalgia to those present prior from that time-period.
          </p>

            r.e.m. beauty is said to be cruelty and paraben free as well as

          <p class="text">
            A new fragrance from the Grande franchise has been in the works
            prior to the release from another previous perfume. The singer’s
            ‘Cloud’ has been a perfume many have purchased since its release in
            fall 2018. It has become one of Grandes most known and favorable
            perfume as it won 'Fragrance of the Year' in 2019. Due to its
            popularity, the singer announced a new version of the original
            called Cloud Pink which released in August.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The new perfume is said to have the same DNA as the original,
            however it is meant to smell more fruity. The fragrance, Cloud, has
            top notes of lavender, pear, and bergamot. Middle notes of coconut,
            praline, and vanilla orchid. Base notes of sensuals musks and blonde
            woods. Cloud Pink is however filled with pineapple and berries as
            its top notes. Middle notes are quite similar and as far of base
            notes, Cloud Pink contains amber woods, magenta moss, and musk that
            can be feel more powering.

            The pop superstar’s first studio album, Yours Truly, has hit 10
            years since its release. Grande has surprised fans with a full week
            of exciting events to celebrate her first recording album. On
            Instagram, the singer announced in a short video that she will
            release live versions of 5 tracks from the album all recorded during
            her time in London, United Kingdom as well as special Q&As, new
            merchandise collection, and unseen footage from the making of the
            album.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande had planned and recorded a few of the tracks months prior to
            the 10 year time mark. The festivities began on the 25th of August
            and will conduct until the following week. Many fans have been
            anticipating for Grande to return to music as she now has been
            primarily focused on her beauty line and movie role. Fans can view
            her live performances on Youtube as well as listening to the live
            version on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The first day of the long week of celebration will be a performance
            of the tracks “Honeymoon Avenue” and “Daydreamin’”. The following
            day will be part one of the Q&A with a merch capsule. The third live
            performance of the track “Baby I” will be preceded and after that
            day, the second part of the Q&A and vinyl pre-order will continue.
            Eventually fans can get a hold of the two live performances of the
            tracks ‘Tattooed Heart” and “Right There”. Lastly, the final live
            performance of the lead single “The way” with unseen footage of the
            making of the album on the last day.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This new re-release also conducts Grande’s 10 year mark of her
            officially being in the music industry for an entire decade. With
            Grande’s constant effort in becoming a well known pop icon, it has
            caused her to be a leading contender on who is this generations top
            pop vocalist.

                Singer Ariana Grande may be preparing and undergoing a new music
                era. The pop star has been caught by paparazzi in New York where
                Grande is known to always record and work on music. Paparazzi
                and fans have approached her in public about any new music in
                the works, but Grande has either denied the speculations or
                ignored the questions being asked.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Fans have also noticed and put two and two together about the
                past and how it may reflect what Grande is doing at this very
                moment in Fall 2023. Grande has been seen carrying her laptop
                everywhere just as how she did in 2020 right before announcing a
                new album. Could this be a coincidence?
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Fans who met Grande in an elevator in New York had shared their
                encounter with the singer and mentioned in their post that the
                building they were in had a recording studio. This could
                possibly be the start of her returning on music, however this
                could also overall be a theory of her current working status.
                The pop star has a lot on her plate and can be prioritizing
                other projects that are not related to music.

        <div class="paragraph-5">
          <p class="text">
            Fans have been desperately wanting pop star Ariana Grande to make a
            comeback with a brand new single. The singer’s last album,
            positions, dropped in fall 2020 and has not dropped personal music
            since. Due to this, fans have tried everything in their power to
            attract new music. Fans have used technology to use Grande’s voice
            to cover other favorable songs with the use of AI, but mainly found
            ways to sneak into the singer’s music catalog and leak unreleased
            songs. Many songs and other personal projects like music videos,
            behind the scenes footage, and more were also leaked to the public.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Many fans have been reluctant to listen to the leaks and rather
            instead spread the music to all social platforms. The singer’s
            unreleased songs have made its way to social media app TikTok where
            the song fans called ‘fantasize’ began getting recognition. The song
            gathered around 5 hundred million videos from the audio itself.
            TikTok, known for its trends and dance videos allowed users to
            create a short dance for a chorus of the singer’s unreleased track.
            This viral dance caused the song to get its recognition.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The pop star is fully aware of these leaks spreading as she is one
            of the most followed female celebrities on every social platform. In
            a recent makeup tutorial posted on r.e.m. beauty’s Youtube channel,
            she answered question and addressed issues of her personal music
            stating, “You guys have heard bad song and bullsh*t demo that I’ve
            ever made.” She has urged fans to stop spreading unreleased music
            that she has kept personal to her and her music team.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This leaves fans wondering if it will cause the singer to continue
            her music hiatus or if she returns to music, will she decide to
            release the viral unreleased hit?
