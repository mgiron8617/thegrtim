              Yours Truly is the debut studio album of the American singer. The
              album was recorded in a span of three years and released through
              Republic Records. The record incorporates a majority of pop and
              R&B elements with a mix of 90’s hip hop. Grande took inspiration
              from previous pop icons who paved the way for her artistry such as
              Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, and Mariah Carey. It debuted at
              number one on the Billboard 200 making the singer one of a few
              female artists to debut their first project at the number one spot
              in the United States. Grande wanted to pay respect and create an
              album that revolved around the music she grew up listening to as a
              child. Her taste in “urban pop, 90’s music” motivated her to
              record an album that was a dedication to old school R&B.

              Grande’s third studio album, Dangerous Woman, was released during
              the spring of 2016. It was previously announced by the singer
              herself that the title would be changed after having a realization
              of the album’s theme. The previous name, Moonlight, was changed to
              the known title as the message and lyrics throughout the album
              revolved around rebelliousness, confidence, love, and broken
              relationships. Critics applauded Grande for her more mature take
              on this project when it came to her lyrics, sound, and vocal
              abilities. This new side of her granted her to debut at number two
              on the Billboard 200 charts and receive grammy nominations for
              both the album and singles released during the era. Many believe
              this album is Grande’s classic pop record, although its diverse
              production from every track.

              After a long wait, Ariana Grande released her fourth studio album,
              Sweetener. She co-wrote majority of the songs and worked with
              producer Pharrell Williams and Max Martin equally for a mix of
              sounds. Many of the songs took a different approach sonically due
              to Pharrell’s type of production, whereas other tracks kept a
              similar sound from her previous work. Many fans and critics seemed
              to have mixed feelings about the production, however the message
              behind the lyrically content overpowered the project as a whole.
              Grande took on themes about anxiety, romance, womanhood,
              perseverance, etc. The album cover became a moment for itself
              after it became her first cover in color as well as being upside
              down. Grande expressed how “upside-down” she felt throughout the
              process of creating this project and thought the simplicity of
              that made her realize the cover should represent that. She
              received her first Grammy win for Best Pop Vocal Album for the
              record.

              In just six months, Grande released her fifth studio album, thank
              u, next, after having just released her fourth. The unexpectedness
              in her personal life made Grande use her passion of music to heal
              from the disaster she was experiencing. Grande worked with her
              close friends to write, produce, and record this new album. She
              previously stated that music is what comforts her and getting to
              create music with people she truly cares about allowed her to
              create a new album in a short amount of time. The album revolves
              around grief, gratitude, growth, and independence. Fans and the
              general public appreciated her vulnerability throughout all the
              tracks and it is now considered her most personal work of art to
              date. Many singles off the record broke streaming records and all
              12 tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

              Ariana Grande’s most recent album, Positions, dropped late 2020. A
              new chapter in the singer’s life gave her the ability to create a
              meaningful work of art with elements of romance expressed
              throughout the record. Being tied to her emotional state, Grande
              decided to also expand on her vocal abilities. All throughout the
              album, people can hear a wide range of the singers voice. Critics
              praised her abilities to showcase more of her vocal abilities
              meanwhile having to also deal with people not being in favor of
              the production of every track. The lead single became a commercial
              success just as her previous lead tracks which paved the way for
              the album to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. It was
              nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 64th Grammy Awards.
              Although not winning, Grande ties Kelly Clarkson with the most
              nominations in the category with five each.
