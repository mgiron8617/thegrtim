        <hr class="under-title" />
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="text">
            Ariana Grande’s interest in acting grew rapidly as the singer
            decided to audition for a nickelodeon role in the show’s,
            Victorious. The show revolves around 16-year-old Tori Vega who
            struggles to fit in within a group of talented teenagers in a
            performing arts high school. Grande flew to LA for the first time
            with her mother to continue with screen test before landing the role
            of Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon show. Grande’s character, Cat,
            is known for her bubbly and ditzy personality who’s easily gullible.
            Before working on filming scenes, a change in Grande’s life had to
            be made. The creator of Victorious, Dan Schneider, had told Grande
            about the cast and each characters look which he then realize he
            wanted Grande’s character to stand out. Schneider wanted Cat to be
            red-headed, therefore Grande had to dye her hair bright red for
            filming. Grande had to dye her hair constantly on a weekly basis for
            her character. This change damaged her natural hair.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Filming and production lasted for a couple months until it finally
            premiered in March 2010 and was viewed by 5.7 million people. It
            marked another successful Nickelodeon live-action show.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            While Grande continuously filmed for Victorious and was known for
            her bubbly character, Grande always had a bigger passion for music.
            She had a YouTube channel called ‘osnapitzari’ and would often post
            videos of her making impressions, covering hit songs, and other
            forms of content for supporters. Her most known videos were her
            covering songs by Adele, Rihanna, and Alicia Keys.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            All throughout her time during Nickelodeon, Grande would post videos
            every so often which allowed her to gain recognition by executives
            of Republic Records. The CEO of Republic Records, Monte Lipman,
            viewed her singing videos and decided to offer Grande a recording
            contract which she gladly signed in 2011. A few months after her
            officially being apart of a music label, Grande released her first
            single titled ‘Put Your Hearts Up’ in December. This single was
            meant to lead up to a pop sounding album that she never continued
            with. To this day, Grande has constantly expressed her dislike for
            it’s bublegum pop sound. She never aspired to create an album that’s
            solely pop influenced. She considers it a single that is a
            reflection of her character Cat if she were to make music. Grande
            also featured on the Victorious soundtrack a few times for songs
            like “Give It Up” which also featured Elizabeth Gillies and “L.A.
            Boyz” who Victoria Justice was also on.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande became getting recognition for her voice all throughout her
            time on Nickelodeon and continued to tease fans along the way to
            expect music soon. She later on released another song that was a
            duet with British singer, Mika, called “Popular Song”. Grande hopped
            on the track as Mika requested and helped to rewrite the lyrics,
            arrangement and, production. The song was inspired and sampled by
            “Popular” from the hit Broadway show, Wicked. The single was not
            only meant for Mika, but also was included in Grande’s debut album,
            Yours Truly.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Eventually the role of Cat Valentine on Victorious came to an end
            abruptly. The show was announced to not be renewed after three long
            years of three seasons. The finale aired early 2013 and marked the
            ending of the first path of the singers career. It was said that the
            show ended due to contract regulations that were never agreed on as
            well as the main star of the show, Victoria Justice wanting to
            pursue other projects in her career.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Eventually Grande was presented with another live-action Nickelodeon
            show reprising her character Cat called, Sam & Cat after Victorious
            ended. This new Nick show was to be considered a spin-off of
            Victorious, but also the hit Nickelodeon show, iCarly. Both kids
            shows ended around the same time and Nickelodeon thought it would
            have been a great idea to create a show combining the two. Sam & Cat
            would star Jennette McCurdy as her original character of Sam Puckett
            on iCarly and Ariana Grande as Cat Valentine. The show would revolve
            around the two stumbling across one another becoming roommates who
            end up creating a babysitting business. The creator Dan Schneider,
            helped make this show come to life and premiered mid 2013. It
            initially began to start off with 20 episodes, but due to its high
            ratings it doubles to 40. Grande became more successful for her
            starring role in the show which awarded her a Kids Choice Award in
            2014 for Favorite TV Actress. The singer kept her role of Cat for
            another year until it was announced Sam & Cat would go on a
            production hiatus. Although its renewal for a second season, it was
            ultimately decided to cancel the show and move past it. It was said
            Grande and McCurdy could not agree to work cohesively knowing that
            Grande was busy pursuing a music career on the side while McCurdy
            had to struggle with disputes between the creator. The finale
            episode aired mid 2014 ending Grande’s connection with Nickelodeon.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Being free from Nick gave Grande the opportunity to work on her
            music career. Not only was she constantly on two hit Nick shows,
            Grande was also apart of other Nick franchises. Grande also voiced a
            fairy princess on Winx Club and was also gaven the role of Amanda
            Benson in the Nick movie, Swindle. It is evident Grande reached a
            high support system from her time on Nickelodeon that gave her a
            boost in her success in music.

          <p class="text">
            Ariana Grande’s debut album, Yours Truly, was released in late
            August 2013. The making of the album took her around 3 years to make
            as she was constantly busy with filming and prioritizing her work
            ethic. Before her album dropped, she had released the lead single
            called, “The Way” with American Rapper Mac Miller being featured on
            the track. The song peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.
            During the next few months from her first official lead single,
            Grande performed at various music festivals and talk show hosts like
            The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
            The second and third single, “Baby I” and “Right There” released
            prior to her album debut and both made it on the Top 100 on
            Billboard.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande had announced a short venue tour called “The Listening
            Sessions” that would conduct before her album release. Fans would
            get to hear songs from tehe album before the entire world had the
            opportunity to do so. Before the tour began, to become prepared of
            touring, Grande opened up for the Canadian singer Justin Bieber for
            his Believe Tour. Grande and Bieber at that time in 2013 were both
            managed by music executive, Scooter Braun. Braun made adjustments
            for Grande to open for an audience that would allow her to not only
            become more well-known, but also become familiar with touring.
            Grande performed for 3 nights right before the first day of her tour
            on August 13.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The Listening Sessions Tour was meant for fans to connect with the
            singer and have a feeling of intimacy by getting to view Grande
            up-close in small venues. Grande’s album dropped halfway through her
            mini-tour that lasted only 11 shows and reached a box office of
            roughly $679,360.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Later in 2013, Grande won her first American Music Award in November
            for New Artist of the Year. To finish of the year, she released a
            Christmas EP called, “Christmas Kisses” and was also one of many
            performers for iHeartRadio’s annual Jingle Ball music festival.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The rollout for Grande’s sophomore album began quickly compared to
            her debut album. The singer began to work with new producers and
            song writers all throughout 2014. Attending award shows and being on
            the cover of magazines were occuring while working on music, but
            getting to perform at The White House was a big accomplishment for
            Grande. In March, Grande was invited to attend and perform for the
            concert, “Women of Soul: In Performance at the White House”, during
            Obama’s presidency. She sang two songs one being her own song,
            “Tattooed Heart”, and the other being a song by Whitney Houston
            called, “I Have Nothing”. Many attendees were able to witness the
            rising pop-stars talent which got her the opportunity once again the
            following month to perform for The White House’s annual Easter Egg
            Roll event invited by both President Obama and First Lady Michelle
            Obama.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The start of Grande’s second era, My Everything, began in April
            where she debuted her lead single, “Problem”, at the 2014 Radio
            Disney Music Awards. She had Australian rapper Iggy Azalea featured
            on the song and it spawned another hit as it peaked number 2 on the
            Billboard Hot 100. Grande constantly performed her hit song at
            various live shows and talk show hosts. Her second single, “Break
            Free”, featuring German producer Zedd later released as well as the
            trio female collab “Bang Bang”, with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj
            dropped. Grande manged to score three Top 10 hits back to back with
            these songs making her at that very moment the second female artists
            to do so. All three songs have their Music Video uploaded on YuTube
            and each have more than 1 billion views. At the 2014 VMA’s she was
            able to open up the show with her song Break Free and Bang Bang and
            was also able to win Best Pop Video for Problem. Grande officially
            dropped her studio album “My Everything” the day after her VMA
            appearance on August 25.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The following month, Grande was announced as a musical performer on
            Saturday Night Live with American Actor Chris Pratt as the host on
            the 27th of September. Towards the end of the year Grande traveled
            to the UK for numerous events to promote her music while also
            preparing for an upcoming tour she had announced during the same
            month of the album drop. Being a performer was a priority as she
            managed to be a musical performer for multiple music festivals and
            shows such as The Victoria Secret Fashion Show. She was one of many
            singers like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, and Hozier to be a part of
            the annual fashion fashion. Grande’s performance became memorable
            due to an accidental encounter with a runaway model’s outfit that
            hit her while performing.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            To end the year, Grande released a Christmas single for her fans to
            enjoy for the holidays. She released the music video to it on
            YouTube in mid December. The song, “Santa Tell Me”, has made its way
            to be considered this generations classic Christmas song as it
            continues to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 every year during
            December.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            In the first quarter of 2015, Grande endured in her first World Tour
            known as, “The Honeymoon Tour”. The tour explored all of North
            America, Europe, Asia, and South America. Throughout her tour, she
            recorded and featured on more songs exclusive for other artists like
            Cashmere Cat and Andrea Bocelli. While completing her first lef of
            the tour in The United States, Grande began filming for a new
            television show called, Scream Queens, on the network, Fox. The
            Comedy Horror show created by Ryan Murphy was about a group of
            college girls who are being threatened by a serial killer. Grande
            was a supporting role for the character, Sonya Herfmann, but mainly
            known as Chanel #2. Grande left the series as her character was
            killed in the show. She continued with her successful tour until it
            concluded in late October in Brazil.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            In December Grande announced a new EP fans should expect to come out
            for Christmas. The EP, Christmas & Chill contains 6 tracks all

            Initially, Ariana Grande’s third studio album began in 2015 by
            recording songs for the album. Grande had released a solo single
            titled, “Focus”, that would lead up to the album release. It was
            later decided to be removed and be its own song. The song was
            previewed on her first fragrance promotional ad and fully released
            the next month. In interviews, she had begun teasing a new album in
            the works on talk show hosts like Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel.
            Grande had announced that the album would be called, Moonlight, but
            as continued to finish off the album, the singer felt the title
            should need to be changed to represent to the theme of the album. It
            was later revealed in February 2016 on Snapchat that her upcoming
            album would be called, Dangerous Woman. The lead single was the
            title track and debuted on the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The
            single continued to be promoted all throughout the following month.

          <p class="text">
            It was not until May 22nd where an unbelievable tragedy occurred
            right after Grande performed the last song on the set-list. A
            suicide bomb was the cause of the incident which killed 22 people
            and left more than 500 individuals injured. Many of these victims
            consisted of young fans who were anticipating this day to enjoy
            their favorite popstar perform. Grande suspended the tour for a
            brief period to raise aid for the victims families. She held a
            televised benefit concert, One Love Manchester, on June 4th which
            many artists came to perform various songs to show support. The
            concert was able to raise $23 million for the affected families. Due
            to her heartwarming efforts, The city of Manchester named Grande the
            first honorary citizen of Manchester. She later on resumed with her
            world tour until the end of September.

            time. She began working on her new record prior to 2018 with
            producer Pharrell Williams. Grande was no where to be seen as she
            went on a hiatus from any social gathering all throughout the fuirst
            quarter of the new year. She only appeared in public once to show
            support to the movement, March For Our Lives. Grande performed her
            own song , “Be Alright”, to advocate for the student led
            organization on gun control.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            In April 20th, Grande released the lead single of her upcoming
            album, “no tears left to cry”. It peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard

            singles in the top 10. To promote her new song, she was a surprised
            guest for the DJ Kygo’s set at Coachella. Grande also went on The

            of her new hit. Not only did she perform, she took over the entire
            show to give viewers skits and answers to any question on the album.

            fans gave mixed feelings of the new project. The album is considered

            her first song to debut at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the
            United States. Many fans were shocked at the release of the single.
            It only happened to be released due to the circumstances of the
            singers personal life during this very time. The single broke
            multiple records on music platforms. The music video broke the

            released the viral hit song, “7 rings”. The second single of the
            upcoming fifth album broke more records and surpassed most
            achievements set by the singer herself from her lead single. The

            confidence and fierce persona all throughout the song. The album,
