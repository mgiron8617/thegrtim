            Ariana Grande, born on June 26 in the year 1993, grew up in Boca
            Raton, Florida. Grande was raised primarily in Florida by her two
            parents, Joan Grande, a CEO of a company that manufactures safety
            and communication equipment and has been a successful business
            franchise since 1964, the year the Grande family owned the company.
            Her father, Edward Butera on the other hand owned a graphic design
            firm located in Boca Raton. Grande has an older half-brother named
            Frankie who is also a widely known celebrity personality in media
            and in Broadway productions. Grande’s connection with her maternal
            grand-parents are also strong and tight.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            As she grew up, her family become aware of her singing voice. At the
            age of 3, Joan became fond of Ariana’s singing. She had heard Ariana
            singing in the backseat of her car listeing to NSYNC and had to
            quickly ask her if it was her hitting the high notes from the song.
            Her mother acted on her ability to sing and began to help her
            develop a vocal range by placing her in audition rooms for plays.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande has always been pushed to become successful as she was placed
            in a private school, Pine Crest School as well as North Broward
            Preparatory School in Florida. These two institutions prioritize
            their students to strive for excellence and develop life long life
            long skills.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            While the singer was striving academically, she was also exploring
            the realm of the arts by performing in musicals in places as Fort
            Lauderdale in which she got the main role of Annie in the musical,
            Annie. This began her interest in musical theatre to become a
            fascinated actor and musician following the path of her families
            love of the performing arts.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            At the young age of 8, the singer sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” at
            a Panthers hockey game in her home state Florida. Audience members
            and viewers quickly realized that she had a voice that could shine
            greater as she continues learning.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            During this time, her parents filed for divorce which led to a bad
            environment for her mentally. Grande had lost connection with her
            father and no longer felt supported by him. The two had their ups
            and downs, but Grande maintained her head up by continuing musical
            theatre and manifesting her life-long aspirations.

            In 2008, Grande was only 15 years old when she began her breakout
            career in acting. Her consistent passion for musical theatre landed
            her a supporting role in Broadway’s musical, 13. Grande got the role
            of Charlotte, a popular cheerleader who enjoys to hang out with
            friends.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande had been in New York with her home-town friend, Aaron Simon
            Gross who grew up together with the singer. Both being driven about
            their passion, they auditioned for the musical and luckily got the
            opportunity to return and be casted out of the hundreds of teens
            that were trying to get the part. Grande had to balance school with
            acting when joining the musical, therefore left North Brodward
            Preparatory School, while still being enrolled in the institution.
            Tutors and work assignments were provided throughout her stay in New
            York to continue her route to graduation.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The musical focuses on an incoming student who learns to navigate
            new social dynamics in school. It consists of a group of teenagers
            learning to adapt to romance, bullying, and culture. 13, the
            musical, premiered in early October 2008 and lasted for a few months
            until January the following year.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This new time in Grande’s life blossomed a new life-long friendship
            with co-star Elizabeth Gillies who they met on set. Gillies landed
            the role of Lucy, fellow cheerleader. Due to their time on set
            together, the two got really close and would spend most of their
            free time in New York shopping. Their teenage years allowed them to
            mature and explore the real world together.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The musical gained atteNtion for it’s amazing production and work
            within the team. Grande was able to be recognized, along her fellow
            cast members, with a national Youth Theatre Association Award.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="text">
            The pop star grew up surrounded with music and theatre. It all makes
            sense as to why her obsession with acting and music is strong. Being
            put in audition rooms to perform for casting directors and belt out
            high notes for them became a passion Grande obtained early in her
            life.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The talented singer had aspirations to pursue a life-long career in
            the realm of acting or music. Grande had sent an audition tape for a
            brand new Nickelodeon show creatde by Dan Schneider while her time
            in New York. It was not until later on that she finally receieved a
            call back and flew to Los Angeles, California with her mother to
            continue the audition process. The hit Nickelodeon show revolving
            around a performing arts school, allowed Grande to continue her love
            for music making.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Pursuing a music career is what was actually the hardcore dream.
            Grande started to delve more in the music scene by creating a
            Youtube channel dedicatd to posting covers of hit pop and R&B songs.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            As the years went by, Grande created a name for herself thorughout
            her time being on Nickelodeon gravitating towards a kid and teen
            audience. This allowed the talented singer to succeed in her music
            career dropping songs every yearly while simultaneously performing
            at award shows and concerts. Throughout the years, Grande has always
            been a lyrical artist writing songs on her own as well with her
            friends in studio sessions. Many singers and friends Grande has
            collabrated with have stated various times how her work ethic is
            beyond the expectations the public has on her. Grande is a vocal
            engineer in the studio and can produce recordings on her own. This
            interest has been a passion for her since the start of her love for
            music and kept up with new musical technology everyday.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="text">
            Singer Ariana Grande is widely known for her love of 1960s glamour,
            music, fashion, etc. Everything pop culture related during that era,
            Grande loves and appreciates. Many fans can pin-point many
            similarities to how her obssession with 1960s pop culture has
            influnced Grande’s overall image. In terms of her fashion sense,
            make-up, interests, or even music taste, Grande showcases a bit of
            nostalgia from the past.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Grande has always stated in interviews how many of her musical
            influences and pop icons are British actress Audrey Hepburn,
            American actress Marilyn Monroe, Singer Mariah Carey, American
            singer and actress Judy Garland, and many more. Grande is a super
            fan for these pop icons who have shaped a new path for the next
            generation of women. The pop star has always given her flowers and
            respect to those who influenced her image and persona.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Due to her obsession to 60’s to late 1900’s culture, her reasons for
            her decison making is evidently clear to what inspired her to pursue
            such choices. Her beauty line, r.e.m. beauty, was primarily designed
            to interpret retro sci-fi. As stated before in interviews, the goal
            was to present r.e.m. beauty that could be present during the
            vintage life of what is considered the 1960’s.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Another way where she encompasses her love of the 60s as mentioned
            before is her fashion. The singer believes her fashion replicates
            timeless clothing pieces that could fit during the era she loves.
            Her notable all-time fashion icon, Audrey Hepburnn, is who many fans
            suspect inspired her wedding dress in 2021. Grande wore a silk,
            empire-waisted, gown with a veil that incorpared a thin satin bow on
            top of the head who many seem to believe payed homage to Hepburns
            veil in the classic film, Funny Face. Although Grande is known for
            her own iconic fashion sense of oversized clothings paired with knee
            high boots and a high ponytail, most of her choices always take into
            account old hollywood galmour. Speaking of glamour, Grande’s go-to
            make up is a natural 60’s cat eye.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The pop star’s persona is not just what inspires her, her musical
            style is fully inspired by vocally talented female singers. Grande
            grew up listening to many female artists from the 90s such as Mariah
            Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston. Listening to such talented
            women is what many would say allowed her to gain such a powerhouse
            voice. Other prominent singers in Grande’s life consisted of
            Destiny’s Child, Brandy, Judy Garland, and India Arie. It is evident
            the singer grew a passion for music knowing that she had quite the
            majority of idols she grew a fond of.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            With this wide range of talentend musicians, Grande leared to evolve
            throughot her musical catalog by exploring other genres besides her
            best known, pop. Music genres such as R&B, Soul, Jazz, Trap, and
            Electronic are to name a few. Imogen Heap is an artists in
            particular Grande has endoresed for her “intricate” structure sof
            songs. Not only has Grande praised her songs, but also learned to
            navigate the invention of Imogean Heaps, MiMu Gloves. These Gloves
            allow singers to alter their voice through technology by performing
            unique hand gestures. MiMu Gloves, invented in 2010, were used for a
            short segment in Grandes first world tour. Grande is seen wearing
            these gloves when performing the track, “Why Try”. Since then, the
            singer has constantanly appreactied Heaps influence in the music
            industry and continues to be inspired by her in her music.
