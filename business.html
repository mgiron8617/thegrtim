            r.e.m. beauty began its journey in November 2021 with its first
            chapter (drop). Grande began working on her makeup line years prior
            to release to perfect a creation she has always dreamed of having
            the chance to have as a teenager.

          <p class="text">
            The brand gets its name from one of Grande’s track on her album,
            Sweetener. Her love and obsession to the meaning of the song became
            an instant realization that it would represent the best message
            towards the creation of starting a makeup line. In a interview with
            Glamour, she states, “I decided to name it r.e.m. because I feel
            like that song really encompasses a lot of my favourite parts of my
            sound. But also, r.e.m. – rapid eye movement – focuses on dreams and
            the eyes which are our main storytellers. They’re our most emotional
            communicators,” she explains in her famous sing-song voice. “Like
            you can say more with the way that you look at someone than you can
            say with words sometimes. Our eyes are what we use to dream and
            rest. So much beauty happens there. I sort of love that,” she nods”.

            Grande also wanted to create a make-up brand that visually
            represents her. She finalized her vision by ceating mood boards to
            give her brand an aesthetic she loves. Grande came up with idea of
            resembling makeup that could have had existed from the 60’s. Her
            obssession with 60’s pop-culture and vintage sci-fi gave her a
            vision to create packaging that resembles that era. Incorporating
            astronaut, planets, and 60’s fashion through her promotionals and ad
            campaigns, fans can get an idea of who Grande expresses herself to
            be as.
